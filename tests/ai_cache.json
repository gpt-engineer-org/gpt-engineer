The program will be simple, consisting of a single script that writes \\\"Hello World!\\\" to a file named `output.txt`.\\n\\nThe core function necessary for this task is a function that encapsulates the file writing operation. This function will be named `write_hello_world` and its purpose is to open a file in write mode and output the string \\\"Hello World!\\\" to it.\\n\\nLet's start with the entrypoint file:\\n\\nmain.py\\n```python\\ndef write_hello_world(file_path):\\n    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:\\n        file.write(\\\"Hello World!\\\\n\\\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    write_hello_world('output.txt')\\n```\\n\\nSince this is a very simple Python script, there are no additional imports or classes needed, and no external dependencies to include in a `requirements.txt` file. The script can be run directly in a Python environment.\\n\\nThis concludes a fully working implementation.\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"response_metadata\": {\"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"logprobs\": null}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"name\": null, \"id\": null, \"example\": false}}]", "[{\"type\": \"system\", \"data\": {\"content\": \"You will get information about a codebase that is currently on disk in the current folder.\\nFrom this you will answer with code blocks that includes all the necessary unix terminal commands to:\\na) install dependencies\\nb) run all necessary parts of the codebase (in parallel if necessary)\\nDo not install globally.
